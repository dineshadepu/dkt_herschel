	abstract = {We present a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) scheme suitable to model spatially resolved flow of arbitrarily shaped rigid bodies within highly viscous fluids. Coupling to other methods is avoided by representing both fluid and solid phase by SPH particles. The scheme consists of two elements, an implicit viscosity solver and a rigid body solver, both of which are adapted from existing literature. We present how both methods can be coupled with ease and little modification. The scheme presented in this paper can be used for simulations of a representative volume element in which the motion of rigid bodies can be studied in defined velocity gradients composed of elongation and/or shear conditions. The scheme only requires stabilization by particle shifting. However, this causes the loss of exact momentum and energy conservation at the boundary between fluid and rigid bodies. Results are shown for both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional simulations including academic cases with existing analytical solutions and industrially relevant cases of semi-dilute suspensions of rigid bodies of various shapes.},

Nearly neutrally buoyant nearly spherical calcium-alginate particles were used as model food particles. The capability of the SPH–DEM methodology was successfully validated in non-Newtonian single-phase as well as in two-phase particle–liquid flows by comparing the local phase velocity flow field, radial particle distribution, and particle passage times with experimental Lagrangian measurements obtained by a technique of positron emission particle tracking. The simulations also yielded accurate predictions of flow pressure drop. In addition, detailed information was afforded on local particle spin, fluid pressure, and carrier fluid vorticity. The results demonstrate the high capability of the proposed numerical framework to predict the complex features of complex particle–liquid flows in pipes.},

	abstract = {The drafting, kissing, and tumbling (DKT) of a pair of particles in Newtonian fluids are frequently observed in particle sedimentations and have been well studied. However, sedimentation shows distinct behaviors when the particle pair is released in non-Newtonian fluids, and dynamics of the DKT have still not been completely understood. In this paper, the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method with a hybrid multiple-relaxation-time scheme is used to examine the dynamics of the DKT of a pair of particles settling in non-Newtonian fluids. The particle pair is released in a confined channel filled with non-Newtonian fluids, in which the non-Newtonian behaviors of shear-thinning/shear-thickening and yield stress are considered. The results demonstrate that the horizontal migration direction at the initial stage of the separation state in a shear-thinning fluid is totally different from that happening in a Newtonian fluid. It is attributed to the asymmetrical fluid viscosity on both sides of the pair of particles. Our findings also show that yield stress plays a dominant role in the sedimentation velocity and separation distance between the particles forming this pair. Under the effect of yield stress, three sedimentation structures, which correspond to different dynamic behaviors of the pair of particles, are also identified during the sedimentation. Furthermore, some critical conditions, regarding horizontal migration toward the right or left side, DKT/non-DKT and kissing/non-kissing states are established through the Bingham number (Bn)-power-law index (n) diagrams and tables. Also, the effect of the diameter ratio between two particles on the DKT is studied.},

	abstract = {The settling of circular and polygonal particles within non-Newtonian fluids is investigated by combining the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) and the discrete element method (DEM). The immersed moving boundary (IMB) scheme with good numerical stability is adopted to couple LBM and DEM. To efficiently calculate the solid coverage ratio in IMB, a novel method is developed, which simply involves judging whether the square is fully occupied by the particle and subdividing the square crossed by the fluid–solid boundary. After validations, the drafting–kissing–tumbling dynamics of two particles settling in the Newtonian and power-law fluids are studied first. It shows that the shear-thickening fluid has a longer kissing duration than the Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids. The kissing duration of squared particles (0.29–0.41 s) is shorter than triangular particles (0.32–0.84 s) and much shorter than circular particles (0.61–0.98 s). Then, the settling of multiple and multi-shape particles in a closed cavity is analyzed. The disturbed area of kinematic viscosity induced by particle motion in the shear-thinning fluid is 21.0–22.5 cm2, significantly larger than in the shear-thickening fluid (10.1–10.8 cm2). Circular particles have a larger disturbed area than the polygonal particles due to the larger settling velocity. Moreover, compared with the Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids, the shear-thickening fluid has a smaller vertical length of particle cluster, meaning a positive influence on the agglomeration of particles.},

	abstract = {Thixotropic materials are complex fluids that display time-dependent viscosity and/or yield-stress response upon the application of a fixed deformation, while recovering their original structured-state when the deformation is discontinued. Thixotropic effects are presents in many different systems and applications, ranging from food products, such as ketchup, to metals, such as molten aluminum. In this work we present a first attempt to simulate the rheological properties of thixo-viscoplastic flows using a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic (SPH) method. The study set up is a 2D flow around a circular cylinder as well as a simple shear flow between parallel plates to validate our numerical results. SPH solutions are compared with simulations performed using the open-source Finite Volume Method solver RheoTool, based on OpenFOAM. The viscoplastic model used in this work is the Papanastasiou model combined with a recently developed microstructural one, in order to include thixotropy. In this thixo-viscoplastic framework, we analyze the flow properties in terms of yield-fronts, streamlines and structure-parameter fields at different Bingham and Thixotropy numbers, through microstructural thixotropic and yield-stress parameters variation. Obtained results show an important novelty: an asymmetry in the thixo-viscoplastic flow around the cylinder.},

The Herschel–Bulkley model is used to describe non-Newtonian fluids. A sub-particle term is added in the momentum equation based on a large eddy simulation. The graphic processing unit (GPU) acceleration technique is applied to increase the computational efficiency. Three test cases including, a static tank, Poiseuille flow, and submarine debris flow, are presented to assess the performance of the new multiphase SPH model. Comparisons with analytical solutions, experimental data, and previous numerical results indicate that the proposed SPH model can capture highly transient incompressible two-phase flows with consistent pressure across the interface.},

	abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has become a popular numerical framework of choice for simulating free-surface flows, mainly for Newtonian fluids. The topic regarding the simulation of non-Newtonian free-surface flows, however, remains relatively untouched due to difficulties regarding the computation of viscous forces. In previous approaches, the viscous forces acting on each SPH particle were computed explicitly. Non-Newtonian fluids such as Herschel–Bulkley fluids, the effective viscosity between yielded and unyielded regions can differ by several orders of magnitudes; imposing severe time step restrictions for the simulation for explicit methods. Numerically, this can be seen as a stiff problem. We propose a semi-implicit time-stepping approach where the viscous forces are computed implicitly, within the context of SPH. We demonstrate the convergence of the method via a simple 2D test case.},

	abstract = {Flow-driven sediment erosion exhibits multiphase characteristics and involves reversible solid-liquid mass exchange, wherein various rheological models and yield criteria are available, but their cooperative performance remains unclear. Here, six combinations of popular rheological models and yield criteria with varying physics are implemented in the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) to reproduce four classic erosion experiments. We propose a GPU-accelerated Effective Interface Searching Technique (EIST) that reduces computational complexity from O(N2) to O(1). Our results suggest that the combination between Herschel-Bulkley-Papanastasiou (HBP) model and Mohr-Coulomb (MC) criterion best captures the erosion and waterfront, whilst the Drucker-Prager (DP) criterion appears to over-predict the erosion. The HBP-MC model reveals that velocity decreases exponentially and sediment concentration increases linearly before saturation concentration along with the depth in the movable sediment layer. This work provides a robust GPU-based EIST method and a useful reference for identifying appropriate adoptions of rheological models and yield criteria that vary in physics.},

	abstract = {Implicit smoothed particle hydrodynamics method has been proposed to overcome the problem that only very small time steps can be used for high viscosity fluids (such as power law fluids) in order to obtain a stable simulation. However, the pressure field is difficult to simulate correctly with this method because the numerical high-frequency noise on the pressure field cannot be removed. In this study, several improvements, which are the diffusive term in the continuity equation, the artificial viscosity and a simplified physical viscosity term in the momentum equation, are introduced, and a new boundary treatment is also proposed. The linear equations derived from the momentum equation are large-scale, sparse and positive definite but unsymmetrical, therefore, Conjugate Gradient Squared (CGS) is used to solve them. For the purpose of verifying the validity of the proposed method, Poiseuille flows with Newtonian and power law fluids are solved and compared with exact solution and traditional SPH. Drops of different fluid properties impacting a rigid wall are also simulated and compared with VOF solution. All the numerical results obtained by the proposed method agree well with available data. The proposed method shows the higher efficiency than traditional SPH and the less numerical noise on the pressure field and better stability than implicit SPH.},

This study aims to investigate the non-Newtonian characteristics of mineral slurries both experimentally and numerically. Non-Newtonian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and its coupling to discrete element modelling (DEM) framework was initially described. Non-Newtonian rheology of a copper slurry with various solids concentrations was determined experimentally by a rotary viscometer. SPH-DEM modelling of the viscometry test was conducted with both Newtonian and Power-law non-Newtonian settings in fluid phase, and comparisons were performed. Results suggested that the non-Newtonian SPH based method better reflects actual rheological behaviours of the slurry. In addition, DEM parameters exhibited limited impacts on rheology of the solids-liquid mixture, particularly at low solids concertation and high shear rate states. The findings suggested that the non-Newtonian based SPH-DEM method should be used to more accurately model the slurry flows within grinding mills.},
